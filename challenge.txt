Challenge Task:
Objective:

Build a working script or simple tool that can do the following:

1. Accept a public video URL (e.g., Loom or direct MP4 link).
2. Extract the audio from the video.
3. Analyze the speaker’s accent to detect English language speaking candidates. 
4. Output:
  - Classification of the accent (e.g., British, American, Australian, etc.)
  - A confidence in English accent score (e.g., 0-100%)
  - A short summary or explanation (optional) 

This tool will be used internally to help evaluate spoken English for hiring purposes.

What We're Looking For:

Top Priority:

- Practicality – Can you build something that actually works?
- Creativity – Did you come up with a smart or resourceful solution?
- Technical Execution – Is it clean, testable, and logically structured?

You’re free to use any tools or languages you’re comfortable with (Python, JavaScript, no-code tools, open-source APIs, etc.).

Deliverables:

- A working script, notebook, or small app (CLI, Streamlit, Flask—your choice)
- Deploy it somewhere with simple UI so it can be tested by clicking the link

Time Expectation:

This task is unpaid, so please don’t spend more than 4–6 hours. We’re looking for working proof-of-concept, not perfection. If you already have something similar, feel free to repurpose or expand it.
